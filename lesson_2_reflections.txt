What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git init
you create an empty repository, with no commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a temporary place, where you can put your files before creating a commit. It's an intermediate state, in which changes can still be made. 
Also, only the files selected will be part of the stage area and the commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Just add the file with the change to the staging area, and commit one logical change at the time.
