When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I want to share my files or when there are more people who will contribute to them. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want to decide when to share the information, when they are finished, ready to be shared, or at a particular point during the process.
